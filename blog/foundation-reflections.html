<strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>

I learnt that I compare myself to others and their learning journey, even though I understand the detrimental effect of this kind of thinking, I still find it hard to switch myself critical voice off. I also realised I have bad habits in terms of balance, I will work for an extended period of time and forget to take breaks, because of this I have found myself looking at syntax and complicating it, instead of breaking it down. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self - awareness in learning and programming? </strong>
<br>
<br>
I think that the role of values, empathy and self - awareness are important aspects of anything that a person devotes themselves to. Its extremely important to understand your values, it allows you to operate with integrity. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
<br>
<br>
I am surprised how much I am incorporating my learning into my everyday life. I reference back to in conversations with others, and find myself practicing what I have learnt during unexpected times. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
<br>
<br>
I find it difficult to switch into my growth mindset, I am still struggling to get my head around some of the JavaScript syntax and I am finding it difficult to keep my optimism and keep in the mindset that I am capable of learning this skill.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong>
<br>
<br>
Because these core skills are just as valuable as technical skills. The ability to understand yourself translates into the way you interact with others and with your work. It is a valuable skill to have good habits and a healthy mindset, it not only benefits yourself but contributes to unity of your teams. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
<br>
<br>
I think that it was valuable time spent. This learning will continue to serve me in the future and I will use this learning in many aspects of my life.
