From day one my parents have educated me on the importance of values; not just the importance of values as a concept, but the power of using these values to shape the life you want. I have a never-ending list of values; up until recently I really struggled to see the clear impact they have on my thoughts and actions. 
The four core values I try to implement in my life everyday are:

<ul> 
<li><strong>Integrity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Authenticity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contribution</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Success</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1><strong> Ethical Decision</strong> </h1>
<br>

Recently, I struggled with making an ethical decision surrounding the topic of friendships. I cut ties with two of my close friends after years of dealing with negative and toxic behaviour. This whole process was extremely daunting and stressful as I hate upsetting other people but also allowed me to grow and understand the importance of setting boundaries that align with values.

During this time I delved into researching the concept of the Myers-Briggs personality test, in which I discovered my personality type is INFJ-A, within these results it stated that I put my own behavioural ideals onto others behaviour, e.g. just because I make a conscious effort about how my actions and words impact other people doesn’t mean I can hold other people to do the same. For me, this totally delayed my efforts of setting boundaries with these two friends because I thought perhaps my perception of them was tainted by my moral judgement.

However, it came to the point where I cut-ties with them completely, not in the way I would have liked, and I still feel incomplete when it comes to thinking of how our friendships ended. One of my values is Integrity and for me getting complete and having authentic communication with people is a huge role in having Integrity. The consequence of my actions was not being able to set healthy boundaries  and get whole and complete with these two people through proper communication. In future I will communicate authentically and not allow fear to get in the way of setting boundaries with others.

<h1><strong>Culture</strong></h1>
<br> 

I come from a mixed culture background. My mother’s side of the family is from Niue, a small coral island in the Pacific and my dad is from Invercargill with Scottish ancestry. I think having a combination of two cultures in my life is a privilege, and both have a very different distinct set of values. Both sides of my family have taught me to value family. My grandfather (mother) who came to New Zealand from Niue when he was in his early twenties has taught me to be hardworking, humble and to value relationships as they are what will bring light to my life. My father’s side of the family has a love for art and all things intellectual, they have introduced me to many hobbies and interests that shape who I am today. 
<br>
<h1><strong>Strengths & Limitations</strong></h1>
<br>

I will be using the Myers-Briggs test results to summaries my strengths and weaknesses. 

My strengths are <strong> <em>Creative, Insightful, Principled, Passionate and Altruistic. </em> </strong>
    I think my strengths have really served me in the past and are a great representation of what I stand for. I think on this learning journey at Dev, my strengths in being creative, passionate and altruistic will come through as this is what will drive me in my learning process and workflow.
<br>
<br>
My limitations are <strong><em>Sensitive to Criticism, Reluctant to Open Up, Perfectionistic, Avoiding the Ordinary, Prone to Burnout.</em></strong>
I look at these limitations as experiences to learn from, I am a perfectionist and I am sensitive to criticism but I don’t see them as being a limitation career wise, becoming self-aware is important when it comes to learning from your limitations. The only way they stop you from getting where you want is if you don’t take to learn and reflect on your limitations. I can use my self-awareness to learn something about myself each time I find myself operating through a limitation.

<h1><strong>Experience</strong></h1> 
<br> 
In the past 5 years, I have worked part time in retail whilst studying. 
I was a part of one of the larger teams, and we were known as a high performing team who got on extremely well. 
My role in this team was an all-rounder who could help with anything and also a mood-maker. 
Because I was so comfortable with every staff member in my team, whenever there was tension or an issue between others, I was always relied on to help ease the tension or bring clarity to whatever the issue was. 
Every single tension that occurred was easily resolved with authentic communication. 
Instead of becoming involved with group tensions I decided to share with my team members the power of authentic communication, and how it can enable us to not only resolved issues, but bring us together as a team and increase productivity, so we created a vow that any tensions needed to be instantly resolved with communication, so we could continue to work productively together.
