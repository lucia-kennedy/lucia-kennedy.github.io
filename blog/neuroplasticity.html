            <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>

            <br>
            <br> 

            I think having a basic understanding of neuroplasticity is important. When people understand the way their brain works, they can use this to their advantage especially when it comes to training the brain with new information. Also when people have an understanding of this subject, it allows them to a. develop a learning style that works for them and b. do practices every day that strengthens the connection between cells.
            <br>
            <br>

            I think for me it can help me live in the mindset that I can actually achieve anything I want, as long as I apply myself in a way that aligns with the principles of neuroplasticity. I currently practice neuroplasticity, through controlling my thoughts; affirming positive thoughts and redirecting negative ones, I was taught to do this a few years ago and initially it can be hard to practice but once you have a structure in place this method can help you develop a new mindset for life. 
            <br>
            <br>

            There are many ways to increase neuroplasticity, there are many simple ways to increase neuroplasticity including; learning new skills like instruments and dancing, reading fiction, exercising, and even sleeping! There is a large amount of evidence that consistently practicing things to increase your neuroplasticity can actually improve your quality of life and has been proven to help with mental health in particular anxiety and depression. Patients who find themselves being at the impact of a severe brain injury, neuroplasticity can enable them to develop full brain and cognitive functions again.  There are such a broad amount of ways to practice neuroplasticity , so much so professionals actually use different practices for different health issues. Some more practices of neuroplasticity include: Creating Artwork, Brain Games, Travelling, Intermittent Fasting, Non-Dominant Hand Exercise, Learning to Juggle,  and Crosswords and Sudoku.

            <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
            In simple terms, the Research Growth Mindset is based on the idea ‘If you believe your brain can grow, you behave differently’. Similar to Neuroplasticity, RGM relates to the malleability of the brain, but this time focuses on the impact of mindsets. There are two different mindsets, the fixed and the growth. Those who have a fixed mindset do not see the possibility in learning, and define themselves by their failures, often leading to a distinct lack of growth. Those in the growth mindset were deeply engaged, had a much more positive view on learning and allowed themselves to learn from mistakes with the understanding that they will develop the skill with effort and consistent practice. With this information, researchers set about teaching those with fixed mindsets that their abilities were not a fixed element, that in fact it’s all about ‘Neuroplasticity’ and delved into the idea that anyone and everyone can develop neurons and strengthen those neurons, leading to improved brain function (intelligence). This Research Growth Mindset allowed students to transform their school life, with classes going from the lower percentile to the top and there is no doubt that this mindset translates into all aspects of the students’ lives.

            <br>
            
            For me, I learnt about the growth mindset a few years ago, however I think in terms of practice is easier said than done. Coming into this course I knew I would need to function in this mindset, but I still found myself with that ‘self-critical voice’. Researching this topic within dev has solidified the importance of living within this growth mindset and I will make an effort to integrate it into my Dev learning journey.

        <strong>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</strong> 

        <br>
        <br>

        I think having a developed understanding of the growth mindset can really influence my journey at Dev Academy. For me, the biggest way I can incorporate this into my learning plan and strategy is to use the principles of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset with both my technical studies and my behavioural/soft skills. I think the hardest part will be breaking old habits and getting through the dis-comfort zone of learning something new, and this can be done with the mindset that anything is achievable, and any ability can be developed.
