In this blog post, we will be discussing the basic concepts of JavaScript. We have previously discussed HTML and CSS and if I were to describe their relationship, I would say that you could compare websites to houses. When building houses, the first thing that gets done is foundations, framework and basic structure of the house goes up, this is comparable to the function of HTML, a basic framework; only just for a website. Then once that is complete all the style and layout aspects are done in a house: walls, windows, paint, carpet, curtains etc. This is essentially what CSS does when it comes to adding style to a website. HTML provides a basic framework of content and CSS allows us to change our style, layout and add fun elements to a website.

Control flow is the order in which a computer executes its statements in a script. When taking a shower, whether we like to admit it or not our shower routine and order of execution is extremely important to us. The computer has its own ‘routine’ and execution order, unless we give it other instructions. We do this through conditions (if else) and loops(for). This disruption process is called ‘control flow’.

The DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents web pages and is an interface that shows us the structure of our HTML document. We can use this to manipulate the pages style, content, and JavaScript structure. In the example below you can see how we have used the getElementByID and .innerHTML to change the inner HTML through the DOM.

Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values. In code, Objects are used to represent things (anything that is defined by a characteristic) In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.

Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions contain instructions for the computer to carry out, these are written inside the body and given a function name. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions. Functions are great and extremely useful as we don’t have to continuously repeat an instruction when we need the computer to do the same thing again and again and again.
