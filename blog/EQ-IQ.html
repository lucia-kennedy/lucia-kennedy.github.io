            <h1><strong> What is Emotional Intelligence? </strong></h1>
            <br>
            <br>

            The official definition of Emotional Intelligence is as follows:
            <br>
            <br>

            Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            In my own experience EQ is a skillset that is learned and developed, It takes commitment to yourself and to others to be able develop this skill. Emotional Intelligence is often broken up into attributes, here are some of the most common attributes that pop up when discussing EQ:
            <br> 
            <br>
            <ol>
            <li> <strong> Self Awareness – </strong> Emotionally intelligent people have self-control when it comes to their feelings, they also have a deep understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and allow these to guide them on the path of self-improvement. </li>
            <br>
            <li> <strong> Social Awareness – </strong>This is can be described as empathy, have an understanding of the impact our own actions can have on others, It can also allow us to have an understanding of others reactions. </li>
            <br>
            <li> <strong> Mindfulness - </strong>Being present to yourself and others, and being present to the current world and often this mindfulness can translate into being solution-focused – looking for what can be done, in the moment, to problem solve.</li>
            <br>
            <li> <strong> Integrity – </strong>People with a high emotional intelligence, often understand the value of operating with integrity, something I have noticed that if you aren’t operating with integrity this correlates into your other practices such as Mindfulness. </li>
        </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            IQ measures your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ measures your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions. The biggest element that  differentiates the two is that EQ has a great impact on your relationships with others and impacts a large amount of areas in your life and EQ actually helps on our journey to self-actualisation. 
            <br>
            Developing a strong skill of Emotional intelligence can lead us on the path to a fulfilled and happy life, if we practice the framework created by the  above attributes, we can live a powerful life, in our social, work and family environments. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of career, emotional intelligence is vital. Individuals (from interns to managers) with higher EI are better equipped to work cohesively within teams, deal with change more effectively, and manage stress – thus enabling them to more efficiently pursue business objectives. Emotional Intelligence provides us a with a framework for life, it enables us to empower ourselves and those around us.
